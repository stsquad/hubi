* *Homogeneous Unified Builder Interface*

Welcome to the *Homogeneous Unified Builder Interface* or *HUBI*

This is a "batteries included" extension for Emacs for building
software projects.

It presents transient interface when you can select the build tool,
build directory and target before invoking the build. It tries to
probe for build configuration so it can offer a narrowing list of
targets. The current build and history is stored in a per-project
.dir-locals2. file.

* History

A lot of the probe and configuration is inspired by `counsel-compile`
which I was also involved in developing. However the hope is the
transient interface presents a more natural interface for tweaking
things like build parameters than a pure narrowing interface.

* Installing

If there is interest I have no problem adding this to ELPA or MELPA.
However currently its origin as one persons pet quality of life tool
makes it suitable for those with an adventurous spirit who are happy
running the code out of a git tree.

Checkout the repository and then you can use something like
use-package to load it:

#+begin_src elisp :lexical no
  (use-package hubi
    :load-path "/path/to/hubi.git"
    :bind ("C-c c" . hubi))
#+end_src

* Invocation

`M-x hubi` or your preferred global keybinding and you should be
presented with an interface like this:

Once you have selected the target and setup `C-c C-c` will invoke the
build tool. `C-g` will quite the interface.
