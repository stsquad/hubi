#+TITLE: Hubi Tasks

* Project Housekeeping [5/5]
 - [X] Update Copyright year in `hubi.el` to 2025
 - [X] Remove hardcoded `my-core-count` from `hubi-make-args`, use `num-processors` from =subr.el= instead.
 - [X] Fix docstring indentation and trailing whitespace in `hubi.el`
 - [X] Check for `jq` dependency - Meson and Cargo target discovery currently relies on `jq`. We should check for its existence and perhaps provide a fallback or a clearer error message.
 - [X] Fix typos in `README.org` - "quite" -> "quit", ".dir-locals2." -> ".dir-locals-2.el".

* Code Improvements [3/4]
 - [X] Refactor `hubi--string-contains-p` usage - Check if `assoc-default` or a more standard `assoc` with a custom predicate is cleaner.
 - [X] Improve dependency handling - Explicitly handle `projectile` or `project.el` if they are intended to be optional or required.
 - [X] Audit `lexical-binding: t` - Ensure it's working as expected and no free variables are accidentally used.
 - [ ] Evaluate CMake support - Currently supports Make, Ninja, Meson, Cargo.

* Documentation [3/3]
 - [X] Update Installation instructions - Mention `transient` as a dependency.
 - [X] Document `jq` requirement - Specify which build systems require `jq` for target discovery.
 - [X] Add "Supported Build Systems" section - List Make, Ninja, Meson, Cargo and any specific requirements for each.

* Packaging [3/3]
 - [X] Add `Package-Requires` header to `hubi.el`
 - [X] Add `Version` header (0.1.0)
 - [X] Clean up repository - add hubi.elc to `.gitignore`.
